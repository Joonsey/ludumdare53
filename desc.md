#Theme: 'Delivery'


#IDEA:
Hectic post office, with one, or multiple conveyor belts with incomming packages that needs to be handled in particular ways.

Inspired by katy stampwhistle quest in WoW and Overcooked 2.

The player will need to interact with tools, like a stamping tool and change his behaviour depending on the packages. (i.e: fragile, urgent, heavy).
